        <span>EV3Lessons was founded in 2014 by Sanjay and Arvind Seshan (who were 9 and 11 years old at the time) as a way to share high-quality, open-source MINDSTORMS programming lessons. They are also the primary authors of
                the lessons. Their first mission is to provide all robotics students with a good starting point for coding well. They provide the building blocks for success. A second goal is to create a community where MINDSTORMS EV3 users (FIRST LEGO League teams and individuals) share and learn together. Today, the teenagers have over 250,000 users in 175 countries. Their lessons and tools have been translated into other languages through collabortions with students and adults worldwide.</p>
<br>
            <p>Sanjay and Arvind have a long
          history in youth robotics. Their FIRST LEGO League team won the prestigous Champion's award at World Festival.
          They have won a Champion's and Robot Performance award every year in the program for seven straight years. They have also won First Place Programming and the Coach/Mentor Award at World Festival.</p>
<br>
          <p>The Seshan Brothers have also built and programmed robots that have been featured on Discovery Channel, Popular Mechanics, World Robot Olympiad, LEGOWORLD Copenhagen, and World Maker Faires. They have beta-tested products for Carnegie Mellon University's Robotics Academy, Cogmation, Mindsensors, and other major companies. They have also been technical editors of a book related to MINDSTORMS and EV3 programming. They were named MINDSTORMS Community Partners (MCP) by the LEGO Group in 2017 for their contributions to MINDSTORMS and programming education.</p>
